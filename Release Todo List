✅ Rooms re-joinable by DC'd players
    ❌ Keep turn order
    ❌ Prohibit new joiners if they were not in room at game start?

✅ Rooms delete themselves

    Do room empty checks on player online status change
    + Lightweight
    + One listener per client
    + Player array stays ordered
    + Checks only as often as needed
    - Deletes room if all players DC, like wifi failing
    OR OR OR
    ❌ Only delete rooms when they get older than a day; Run a check each day
    + Ezpz, no logic required
    + Checks less often than other options
    - Messy; Lots of leftover rooms each day
    - Makes random room selection possibly take slightly longer
        + That's probs irrelevant tho
    + Lets rooms be rejoined if all players DCd
